# Double Jump
The double jump allows for jumping in mid air to get extra distance and/or height. It is most often found on platformer levels or sections of levels, but it can sometimes be used on cube levels. It is not possible with spider mode.
## Explanation
The player gets the ability to jump when they go from not colliding with a hitbox to colliding with it. If you jump and then touch a block, you will regain your jump, allowing you to jump again mid-air. A simple example is when the player is on a flat surface, with a block protruding from it. The player jumps, touches the block, and regains their jump in mid-air.
## Usage
Here is a partial list of uses of this mechanic in levels:
- Long Boi: Double jumping off one of the small blocks can be used for speedrunning
- Kargoh's World: Double jumping off on of the pillars for a shortcut
- Kargoh's Bobsled: Double jumping off of the end of the second ramp for a shortcut
- Jericho: Double jumping off the resize blocks can be used to setup for a [Corner Boost](corner-boost.html)
- Boxel Nomad: Double jumping off the third solid block can be used to avoid some of the ramp
- Homework: Double jumping can be used for tassing the level
- Mountain Climb: Double jumping can be used in a lot of places to save time
- Dancing on Nothing: Double jumping is required to complete the level, and is part of the level's theme
- Up, Down, and Through: This level uses an interesting variant of the double jump on the intended path
- Wallclimb Ascension: Double jumping off of a textbox can be used for a shortcut
- Spider #1: Double jumping at the end can be used to save time
- Double Jump Hell: Double jumping is the main theme of the level
## History
It is unknown who discovered jumping, or when. Until platformer mode, it was used only for speedrunning. After platformer mode was added into the game, Charlieee1 popularized double jumping with Dancing on Nothing. Nowadays, double jumping is used for speedrunning, skips, and occasionally as a required mechanic for a level.
## Variants
Here is a non-exhaustive list of double jump variants:
- Simple cube/platformer double jump with momentum (Example use case: textbox skip in Wallclimb Ascension)
- Stand-still platformer double jump (Example use case: recovery with spike in the underground section of Mountain Climb)
- Double jump off protrusion from flat ground (Example use case: recovery in Mountain Climb)
- Limited space double jump (Example use case: first jump in Dancing on Nothing)
- Double jump off a pass-through block without a solid block (Example use case: second jump in Dancing on Nothing)
- Double jump off a moving block with platformer (Example use case: double jump off third moving block in Boxel Nomad)
- Double jump off moving block with cube (Example use case: intended route double jump in Up, Down, and Through)
- Double jump off side of block from mid-air (Example use case: first jump in Double Jump Hell)
- Double jump off bottom corner of block from mid-air (Example use case: shortcut in Kargoh's World)
- Sideways double jump through pass-through block (Example use case: second jump in Double Jump Hell)
- Double jump through reset block (Example use case: reset block double jump in Double Jump Hell)
- Double jump off of a self-bouncing moving bounce block (Example use case: Kackiest Kacky #-3)
- Flight with moving block (Example use case: theoretically possible TAS strat)
