# Getting started Modding Boxel 3D

Boxel 3D is a physics-based game built with **Three.js** for rendering and **Matter.js** for physics. Modding the game allows you to modify mechanics, add new features, or change visuals to create a custom experience.

## First Steps to Modding

### 1. Think of an Idea  
Before diving into code, decide what you want to change. Do you want to add a new movement type, or modify physics? Having a clear goal helps guide your modifications.

### 2. Learn JavaScript  
Since Boxel 3D is built using JavaScript, you need to understand its syntax and concepts, such as:  

- Variables, functions, and objects  
- Basic DOM manipulation  
- Understanding **Three.js** (for rendering) and **Matter.js** (for physics)  

### 3. Use a Code Editor  
To write and edit JavaScript code, use a text editor like:  

!!! tip "Recommended Code Editors"
    - **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** â€“ A powerful editor with extensions and debugging tools.  
    - **[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)** â€“ A lightweight option with syntax highlighting.  

### 4. Access the Game Console  
Boxel 3D runs in a web browser, so you can use the built-in developer console to test changes.  

#### Steps to Open the Console:
1. Open the game in a browser.  
2. Look at the introduction page and see "Commands" for steps on how to open the console.
3. Navigate to the **Console** tab to enter JavaScript commands.  

Once you're comfortable with these basics, you can start modifying game elements by injecting custom scripts or editing local copies of the game files.
