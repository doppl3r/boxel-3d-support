ðŸš€ **Usage Example:**  
To listen for an event in Boxel 3D, use JavaScript like this:

## Simple respawn mod

    window.addEventListener("playerRespawn", (event) => {
        console.log("Player respawned:", event.detail.player);
    });

??? info inline "What does this do?"

    This mod listens to when the player respawns. If the player respawns, the console logs "Player respawned"
